# flipaQ

## Description

filpaQ is a study app that is used to create and review "flashcards". I works similar to physical flash cards. A question is displayed on screen and the user answers it. Then with the press of a button the correct answer appears. User create their own flashcards using the webpage interface. The flashcards are saved to their user account.
